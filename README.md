# Component_lib
Just a component database until I get a NAS running

# How to add components:
You can (and should use Library Loader)
Once you dowloaded the .zip of your component (from mouser for example), library loader should do the job (if you are lucky), if not press `Open ECAD Model`
The component should now be in your SamacSys_Parts library

# How to commit:
Once you added components, do
```
git add --all
git commit -a
git push
```
